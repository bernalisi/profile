        I have always been drawn to sports and adventure.
        I am particularly passionate about kitesurfing, skiing, and sailing, and essentially love everything related to nature and all those activities that bring me closer to it.
        My adventurous spirit is complemented by a love for books.
        I find joy in reading everything from non-fiction to novels, with a current fascination for Wilbur Smith's Courtney and Egypt sagas, which have a way of transporting me to different places in the world.
        I also play the guitar, with a particular focus on acoustic, it's my way to nurture my creativity.
        I have had the chance to live in several Western countries: from spending the fourth year of high school in the United States, in Tennessee, to participating in two university exchange programs in Paris and Berlin.
        These experiences all helped me form my current perspective on the world.

        My academic journey led me to Rome, where I pursued business and finance.
        This laid the groundwork for what was to come in my career.
        Afterward, I found myself in the world of consulting in Milan (about 2 years), specializing in helping struggling businesses turnaround, and execute M&As or restructuring plans. It was fast-paced and challenging and learned a lot about small & medium enterprises, as well as their criticalities and general problems currently faced in Italy.
        But a deeper calling beckoned. My true passion lies in entrepreneurship.
        I aspire to make a positive impact on the world by also making a lot of money on the way.
        And here we arrive at this fantastic boot camp: I firmly believe that in 2023 having digital skills, including knowing how to code, will give me an edge.
        Complementing my business/finance background with knowing how to build a solid digital product, or being able to build the digital infrastructure of a deep tech startup, is an awesome perspective.
